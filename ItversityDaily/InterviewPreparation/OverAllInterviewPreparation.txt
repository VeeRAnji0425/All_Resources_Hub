1. Worked on different file formats such as sequence, csv, avro and parquet.
2. Regular expressions in perl, scala.
3. Lambda Expressions.
3. Case classes.
4. ShellScript:
Sed, awk, curl commands. mailx.
---> Unit Testing 
---> Worked on data compression using Snappy with spark SQL.
4. Developing the oozie workflows.
-->SparkScala application which reads the data from hive queries, application transformations and actions, convert to .csv or tab delimited file and load to HDFS.
--> Hive queries. Created external tables. and worked on perl script which reads the data from Local and loads into external tables.
    Oozie workFlow which loads all the data from external tables into Parquet tables.
5. Worked on different kinds of data, Structured and semi structured.
Insert overWrite and partitioning on the update date in handling the incremental data loads.
=================================UHG================
Joining the xml data with the data in Hive using keys. convert to Json format load into Elastic search.
Loads the data into Rdd, Reading the data from rdd, covert to csv or tab delimited.
converted rdd's to Df's and writes to json.
Worked on Map, FlatMap, ReducedByKey etc.
Accumulator's and broadcast variables.
Partitioning the rdd's data across the cluster.
.persist.
Joins. Cartesian Join and cross join's.
Choose the no. of partitions = no. of core's to optimize the spark jobs.
Hashpartitioning and Range partitioning.
================================================== 	
Worked on DataDriven and test driven development.
->Worked on implementing the high-throughput data pipelines
->Build fault-tolerant, scalable batch and real-time distributed data processing systems using Hive, Map-Reduce, Tez, HBase, Java/Python, Kafka, Spark etc.
-> worked on optimizing the spark applications and Hive queries. 
We use agile development techniques such as test-driven development, pair-programming, continuous build and automated testing, adapting these to our needs as necessary at regularly held retrospectives involving developers, operators, support staff, and product owners.
Producing technical designs and documentation at varying levels of granularity
Experience developing service-oriented architectures and an understanding of design for scalability, performance and reliability.
 Familiarity with data serialization formats like XML, JSON and protocol buffers
 ===================================
