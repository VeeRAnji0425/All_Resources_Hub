FileFormats:
     1. ORC File Format: The optimized row columnar(ORC) file format provides a highly efficient way to store Hive data.
        ORC files improves performance when hive is reading, writing and processing data.
     2. Parquet File Format: We created parquet to make the advantages of compressed, efficient columnar data 
        representation available to any project in the Hadoop eco system. Parquet allows compression schemes to be specified
        on a per-column level, and is future-proofed to allow adding more encodings as they are invented and implemented.
